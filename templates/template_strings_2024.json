You will receive one such email per session and/or tutorial. All session details (URLs, Zooms, etc.) are at the end of this email. But read the entire email carefully!\n**Note for Panels:** Please forward this email on to your panelists if any are missing.\n**Note for Workshop/Associated Events:** Please forward this email to organizers if any are missing who need this Zoom information. Please submit additional presenters that are not listed in the Run-of-Show app (see below).\nPlease see below corresponding information for either **Event Organizers** or **Session Chairs**\n\n## Information for Event Organizers \nBelow is a list of the virtual technical capabilities that will be available for your event. All of these capabilities will be used by default. Event organizers should communicate to the Tech Chairs if any capabilities should not be used. These capabilities include: \nPresenters can share screen, video, and audio as participants in the IEEE VIS provided Zoom Meeting. \nStreaming of the entire Zoom Meeting session to a live YouTube broadcast. The YouTube stream will appear unlisted on the ieeevis.org page for the session. After the conference ends, an edited version of the recording will be made public on the IEEE VIS YouTube Channel.\nDiscord channel for discussion.\nSli.do channel for Q+A.\n\n__Speaker Registration__ **Please note that all presenters must register for the conference. The registration includes a video release form that is needed to be included in the conference sessions.** For that reason we cannot allow switching speakers, unless they are registered. Without their consent via registration, we cannot legally share, post, or stream a talk. We understand that with the change to a virtual format, some speakers might choose not to present anymore (e.g., due to time zone differences). However, we would like to make it clear that, unless the new speaker has provided consent, we cannot allow for the switch. \n\n__Event Schedule__ We do not have a detailed schedule of your event, only the accepted papers or posters. Once an A/V Student Volunteer is assigned to your session, you will receive an email with their assignment. Please send the Student Volunteer a version of your event schedule (e.g., on the event website, a spreadsheet, etc.) The Audio-Visual SV will need a schedule to know which presenter to spotlight in the Zoom Meeting.\n\n__Submit Additional Presenters__ In order for all presenters to receive presentation instructions from IEEE VIS, we ask that you submit any additional presenters (e.g., keynote speakers, panelists). As stated above, we do not have a complete list of presenters for your event. We only have presenters that have accepted submissions via PCS. In the Run-of-Show app you can find a list of the presentations and their respective presenters.\n\nRun-of-Show app: {RoS URL}\n\n**Email tech@ieeevis.org with a list of names and emails are format in a list separated by the “|” character. Please follow this format, it will save us valuable time.** If your event includes two sessions (BELIV and EduVis only) - please send us two lists, one for each session. Once your Additional Presenters list has been submitted, their names should be listed in the Run-of-Show app.\n\nFor Example:\nPresenter Names: Name One|Name Two|Name Three\nAdditional Presenter Emails: email_one@gmail.com|email_two@gmail.com|email_three@gmail.com\n\n\n\n__Session Time Change.__ Due to the transition to a virtual conference. There have been a number of time adjustments to the schedule. Please double check your session time, as it might have changed. Please contact your invited speakers to make sure that they are aware of the venue change and that they are registered to log into the virtual conference. All registered VIS attendees should have received emails regarding the change in VIS to a virtual format.\n\n__Technical Difficulties.__ Please contact the presenters of your session/workshop/panel and ask for pre-recorded videos of their talk in case of technical difficulties (e.g., bad internet connection, no-shows, etc.). How to run your session/workshop/panel is up to you, but our recommendation is that if a presenter cannot present effectively (and there's no pre-recorded video available), you should skip the presentation and move on to the next.\n\n__At the end of your session.__ There is a hard cut-off 10 minutes after the session is scheduled to end to allow time to set up the next session, so please keep to the session schedule. We have a limited number of Zoom licenses, and another Zoom Meeting will be taking place after your session. Additional discussion after the session should be directed to continue on Discord.\n\n## Information for Session Chairs\n\nPlease join the session Zoom Meeting 15 minutes before the session to test A/V setups with your presenters. Please also check in with your assisting Audio-Visual Student Volunteer. During the session, the session chair should indicate when it is time to wrap up the presentations.\n\n__As the Chair.__  You can read the paper and watch any preview videos before your session in the Run-of-Show app (see below). You'll be responsible for introducing the talk, keeping time, and handling the live Q&A. Please watch the video [HowTo: chair a session at VIS](https://youtu.be/pWygXAH-9FE) for tips and tricks.\n\n__Live Virtual Q&A.__ After each talk there will be a live Q&A portion, depending on the session structure (associated events and workshops may vary). As the chair, you will field questions virtually from Sli.do. You can select questions from Sli.do and should read them aloud so that they are recorded on the live stream. Please note that there will be a slight delay (around 20 seconds) between the Zoom meeting and Youtube stream. **As session chair, please prepare a first question for each presentation to give the audience some time to produce questions.** \n\n__Session Time Change.__ Due to the transition to a virtual conference. There have been a number of time adjustments to the schedule. Please double check your session time, as it might have changed.\n\n__Technical Difficulties.__ Please contact the presenters of your session and ask for pre-recorded videos of their talk in case of technical difficulties (e.g., bad internet connection, no-shows, etc.).

Please follow this format, it will save us valuable time.</strong> If your event includes two sessions (BELIV and EduVis only) - please send us two lists, one for each session. Once your Additional Presenters list has been submitted, their names should be listed in the Run-of-Show app.<p>For Example:<p>Presenter Names: <code>Name One|Name Two|Name Three</code><br><p>Additional Presenter Emails: <code>email_one@gmail.com|email_two@gmail.com|email_three@gmail.com</code><p><em>Session Time Change.</em> Due to the transition to a virtual conference. There have been a number of time adjustments to the schedule. Please double check your session time, as it might have changed. Please contact your invited speakers to make sure that they are aware of the venue change and that they are registered to log into the virtual conference. All registered VIS attendees should have received emails regarding the change in VIS to a virtual format.<p><em>Technical Difficulties.</em> Please contact the presenters of your session/workshop/panel and ask for pre-recorded videos of their talk in case of technical difficulties (e.g., bad internet connection, no-shows, etc.). How to run your session/workshop/panel is up to you, but our recommendation is that if a presenter cannot present effectively (and there's no pre-recorded video available), you should skip the presentation and move on to the next.<p><em>At the end of your session.</em> There is a hard cut-off 10 minutes after the session is scheduled to end to allow time to set up the next session, so please keep to the session schedule. We have a limited number of Zoom licenses, and another Zoom Meeting will be taking place after your session. Additional discussion after the session should be directed to continue on Discord.<h2 style='color:#c47000;font-family:Helvetica;font-size:24px;line-height:150%;text-align:left;margin:4px 0'>Information for Session Chairs</h2><p>Please join the session Zoom Meeting 15 minutes before the session to test A/V setups with your presenters. Please also check in with your assisting A/V Student Volunteer. During the session, the session chair should indicate when it is time to wrap up the presentations.<p><em>As the Chair.</em> You can read the paper and watch any preview videos before your session in the Run-of-Show app (see below). You'll be responsible for introducing the talk, keeping time, and handling the live Q&A. Please watch the video <a href=https://youtu.be/pWygXAH-9FE style=color:#c47000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;border-bottom-color:#c47000;border-bottom-style:dashed;border-bottom-width:1px>HowTo: chair a session at VIS </a>for tips and tricks.<p><em>Live Virtual Q&A.</em> After each talk there will be a live Q&A portion, depending on the session structure (associated events and workshops may vary). As the chair, you will field questions virtually from Sli.do. You can select questions from Sli.do and should read them aloud so that they are recorded on the live stream. Please note that there will be a slight delay (around 20 seconds) between the Zoom meeting and Youtube stream. <strong>As session chair, please prepare a first question for each presentation to give the audience some time to produce questions.</strong><p><em>Session Time Change.</em> Due to the transition to a virtual conference.

The same Zoom Meeting will be used for earlier and later sessions that day, so please do not join the Zoom other than 15 minutes prior to your session. If you encounter any issues, a Student Volunteer will be the host of the Zoom or you can message our support team via the <a href=https://discord.gg/HauPYcT2 style=color:#c47000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;border-bottom-color:#c47000;border-bottom-style:dashed;border-bottom-width:1px>#Support Discord Channel</a>. You can also contact the Session Chair for help (see contact info below).<p>During the conference, only the presenters, the session chair, and an SV will be on the Zoom call. We'll be streaming live to Youtube. The session chair will keep everything on track with timing for talks and will monitor Sli.do for questions from the audience. When your talk portion ends, the session chair will act as moderator and ask you questions from the audience. Please make sure to check the program and connect with your session chair in advance if possible.<p><em>Checklist for your virtual presentation</em><ol start=1><li style='margin:18px 0'><p>Ensure you have an adequate internet connection for your presentation: 7.5Mbps/5.0Mbps (up/down).<li style='margin:18px 0'><p>Install Zoom Desktop before your session.<li style='margin:18px 0'><p>Create and log in to your Zoom account (can be any school or personal account).<li style='margin:18px 0'><p>Grant Zoom <a href='https://support.zoom.com/hc/en/article?id=zm_kb&sysparm_article=KB0064868'style=color:#c47000;font-weight:400;text-decoration:none;border-bottom-color:#c47000;border-bottom-style:dashed;border-bottom-width:1px>permissions for macOS</a>.
